#this is a prompt gen program made for creating lessons on general subjects
#generated by Llama
#not a great prompt tbh
#I want something very specific
#however this is very nice for a couple of reasons
#there is no error so the categories and aspects below dont really apply
#it is too simple and doesnt ask the LLM to be extensive and specific


# Define categories and aspects
categories = ['History', 'Science', 'Literature', 'Philosophy']
aspects = {
    'History': ['Ancient Civilizations', 'Medieval History', 'Modern History'],
    'Science': ['Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology'],
    'Literature': ['Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Drama'],
    'Philosophy': ['Ethics', 'Metaphysics', 'Aesthetics']
}

# Define the main program
def prompt_generation():
    # Ask user for general category
    print("Please enter a general category you are interested in studying:")
    category = input()

    # Ask user for specific aspect of that category
    print(f"Please enter a specific aspect of {category}:")
    aspect = input()

    # Generate prompt for LLM to generate lesson
    prompt = f"""
Create a short lesson about {aspect} in {category}. Please include a clear topic sentence, supporting details,
    and a conclusion that summarizes the main points."""
    return prompt

# Run the program
print(prompt_generation())

#This program will ask the user to enter a general category they are interested in studying
#(e.g. "History", "Science", etc.), and then ask for a specific aspect of that category
#(e.g. "Ancient Civilizations", "Medieval History", etc.).
#Based on the user's input, it will generate a prompt for a Language Model Learning (LLM)
#to generate a short lesson about that subject.
#The prompt will include a clear topic sentence,
#supporting details, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points.

#For example, if the user inputs "History" as the general category
#and "Ancient Civilizations" as the specific aspect, the program will generate the following prompt:
#Create a short lesson about Ancient Civilizations in History.
#Please include a clear topic sentence, supporting details,
#and a conclusion that summarizes the main points.

#The LLM can then use this prompt to generate a lesson
#on the subject of Ancient Civilizations in History,
#which can be used as a starting point for further learning and exploration.
